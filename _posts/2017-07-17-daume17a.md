abstract: We create a new online reduction of multiclass classification to binary
  classification for which training and prediction time scale logarithmically with
  the number of classes. We show that several simple techniques give rise to an algorithm
  which is superior to previous logarithmic time classification approaches while competing
  with one-against-all in space. The core construction is based on using a tree to
  select a small subset of labels with high recall, which are then scored using a
  one-against-some structure with high precision.
