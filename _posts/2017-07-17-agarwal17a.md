abstract: We design differentially private algorithms for the problem of online linear
  optimization in the full information and bandit settings with optimal $O(T^0.5)$
  regret bounds. In the full-information setting, our results demonstrate that $ε$-differential
  privacy may be ensured for free – in particular, the regret bounds scale as $O(T^0.5+1/ε)$.
  For bandit linear optimization, and as a special case, for non-stochastic multi-armed
  bandits, the proposed algorithm achieves a regret of $O(T^0.5/ε)$, while the previously
  best known regret bound was $O(T^2/3/ε)$.
