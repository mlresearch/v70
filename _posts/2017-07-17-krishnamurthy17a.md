abstract: 'We design an active learning algorithm for cost-sensitive multiclass classification:
  problems where different errors have different costs. Our algorithm, COAL, makes
  predictions by regressing to each label’s cost and predicting the smallest. On a
  new example, it uses a set of regressors that perform well on past data to estimate
  possible costs for each label. It queries only the labels that could be the best,
  ignoring the sure losers. We prove COAL can be efficiently implemented for any regression
  family that admits squared loss optimization; it also enjoys strong guarantees with
  respect to predictive performance and labeling effort. Our experiment with COAL
  show significant improvements in labeling effort and test cost over passive and
  active baselines.'
